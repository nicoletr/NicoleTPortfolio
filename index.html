            <p>
              I have worked in media now for over 8 years. As the industry moves more and more into the digital realm, my interest in web has increased dramatically.
              My initial interest started when I was studying Graphic Design back in 2012. They touched in web design as a unit, but it was the very basics of HTML.
              I always wanted to learn more but never really got the chance, and then I fell into full-time work.
              After seeing this course online, my interest was piqued because it seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally learn more about web development and design.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my current position, I don't feel like there is any room for me to grow professionally. 
              Another basis for my decision to learn this new skill.
              I can see this as a hugely beneficial knowledge to have and am excited for what else is to come.
