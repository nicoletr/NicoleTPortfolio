Week 2 Homework - Portfolio

I have created a Portfolio webpage to add to as the course goes on. Employers will look at this and be able to see my name, contact details, along with the work I have produced throughout the course and after.

I currently do not have any web applications to showcase so I have linked the 'My work' boxes to various existing webpages based on the name.

## Notes
- When the application opens, it loads with no errors.
- Employer is presented with my name, a selection of work and my contact details
- Navigation links work
- 'My Work' application links work
- First application is larger than the rest
- Page has a responsive layout
